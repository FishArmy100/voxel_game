# **Game Idea**:
Like minecraft, but more hardcore.

### **Smaller Voxels:**
- Each voxel is smaller than the ones in minecraft (don't know the scale)
- Voxels are of resources
  - Don't have voxels like 'fence' and 'chiseled stone'
  - Voxels more like: 'sand', 'wood', 'stone'
- Voxel objects:
  - Objects that take up more than one voxel
  - Examples:
    - Chest
    - Furnace
    - Crafting bench
### **World Generation:**
- Infinite in all three directions
- Similar to Minecraft
  - Add more continents
  - Larger seas
  - Floating islands???
### **Dynamic Biomes:**
- Biomes change depending on the blocks in them:
  - Water + Sand = Ocean 
  - Trees + Grass = Forest
  - ect
### **Hardcore Survival Mechanics:**
- Food harder to come by
- Stamina more in line with Monster Hunter?
- Cold/Heat exposure?
### **Crafting:**
- Buildables:
  - Can construct mini 'blocks' composed of multiple different voxel types
    - Fence
    - Pipes
    - Pillars
  - Can be placed in the world
  - Can also be a recipe:
    - Torches
- Non Buildables
  - Food?
- Materials:
  - Can make from raw resources or non buildables
  - Iron ore --> Iron
### **Borrowed from Minecraft:**
- Modifying the world
- Inventory (kind-of)
- Day/Night cycle
